Hasjob can be used with Docker (recommended) or the harder way with a manual setup.

## With Docker

#### Install and run with Docker

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) and [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

* Next, rename the `instance/development.docker.py` to `instance/development.py`

* Build the images

    ```
    $ docker-compose build
    ```

* Initialize the database

    ```
    $ docker-compose run web sh
        web$ python manage.py db create
        web$ exit
    ```

* Start the server
    
    ```
    $ docker-compose up
    ```

* You can edit the server name and Lastuser settings in `docker-compose.yml`

## Without Docker

Hasjob without Docker requires manual installation of all dependencies.

### Postgres and Redis

Hasjob requires Postgres >= 9.4 and Redis. To set up a Postgres DB:

On OS X using the [Postgres App](http://postgresapp.com):

    $ # Add Postgres app to the path if it's not already in there
    $ export PATH="/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin:$PATH"
    $ # Make the user and database
    $ createuser -d hasjob
    $ createdb -O hasjob -W hasjob

On any Linux distribution:

    $ sudo -u postgres createuser -d hasjob
    $ sudo -u postgres createdb -O hasjob hasjob

Edit `instance/development.py` to set the variable `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` to `postgres://hasjob:YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE@localhost:5432/hasjob`.

Redis does not require special configuration, but must listen on localhost and port 6379 (default).

### Local URLs

Hasjob makes use of subdomains to serve different sub-boards for jobs. To set it up:

* Edit `/etc/hosts` and add these entries:

    ```
    127.0.0.1    hasjob.dev
    127.0.0.1    static.hasjob.dev
    127.0.0.1    subboard.hasjob.dev
    ```

* Edit `instance/development.py` and change `SERVER_NAME` to `'hasjob.dev:5000'`

### Install dependencies

Hasjob runs on [Python](https://www.python.org) with the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) microframework.

#### Virutalenv + pip/easy_install

If you are going to use a computer on which you would work on multiple Python based projects, [Virtualenv](docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) is strongly recommended to ensure Hasjob's elaborate and sometimes version-specific requirements doesn't clash with anything else.

You will need to install all the requirements listed in `requirements.txt` using `easy_install` or `pip`:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
If you get an error, try running:

    $ easy_install -U setuptools

__Note__: If you intend to contribute to HasGeek's libraries such as [Baseframe](http://github.com/hasgeek/baseframe), [Coaster](http://github.com/hasgeek/coaster) and [Flask-Lastuser](http://github.com/hasgeek/flask-lastuser) *along* with Hasjob, then uninstall these installed via requirements.txt and manually set up whichever library you plan to work on.

    $ pip uninstall <insert_library_name> # baseframe, coaster, flask-lastuser
    
Clone Baseframe, Coaster and Flask-lastuser and in each of these repositories run:

    $ python setup.py develop

*Why?*: Setting up any of these above libraries independent of Hasjob means you to have to install them every time for your locally installed Hasjob to recognize these changes. The above method of setting up these libraries symlinks the installation back to your cloned repository.

Finish configuration with:

    $ python manage.py db create

Before you run the server in development mode, make sure you have Postgres server and Redis server running as well. To start Hasjob:

    $ python runserver.py

## Periodic jobs

Hasjob maintains user sessions that expire after half hour of inactivity. You need to install a cron script to sweep for expired sessions. Use `crontab -e` as the user account running Hasjob and add:

    */10 * * * * cd /path/to/hasjob; python manage.py sweep -e dev

Switch to `production` in a production environment.

## Testing

Tests are written in [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/).

You need to [install CasperJS](http://docs.casperjs.org/en/latest/installation.html), which needs Python 2.6 (or greater) and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) installed.

Edit the top few lines of test file `tests/test_job_post.js` with the URL, username and password.

Run the test with `casperjs test tests/test_job_post.js`.

## Other notes

If you encounter a problem setting up, please look at existing issue reports
on GitHub before filing a new issue. This code is the same version used in
production so there is a very good chance you did something wrong and there
is no actual problem in the code. Issues you encounter after setup could
be real bugs.

WSGI is recommended for production. For Apache: enable `mod_wsgi` and make a
`VirtualHost` with:

    WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/hasjob/git/repo/folder/website.py

For Nginx, run website.py under uWSGI and proxy to it:

    location / {
        include uwsgi_params; # Include common uWSGI settings here
        uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:8093;  # Use the port number uWSGI is running on
        uwsgi_param UWSGI_CHDIR /path/to/hasjob/git/repo/folder;
        uwsgi_param UWSGI_MODULE website;
    }
