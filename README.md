Hasjob runs on [Python][] with the [Flask][] microframework. You can choose to setup your developmenet environment in the following two ways…

### Virutalenv + Pip/easy_install

If you are going to use a computer on which you would work on multiple Python based projects, it is recommended to use [Virtualenv](docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) to keep isolated.

You will need
to install all the requirements listed in `requirements.txt` using
`easy_install` or `pip`:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

If you get an error, try running:

    $ easy_install -U setuptools

Next, Copy `settings-sample.py` to `settings.py`, edit as
necessary, and finish configuration with:

    $ python manage.py db create
    $ python manage.py configure

To run the server in development mode:

    $ python runserver.py

### Install and run with Docker

You can alternatively run Hasjob with Docker.

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) and [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

* Next, rename the `instance/development.docker.py` to `instance/development.py`

* Build the images

    ```
    $ docker-compose build
    ```

* Initialize the database
    ```
    $ docker-compose run web sh
        web$ python manage.py db create
        web$ exit
    ```
* Start the server
    
    ```
    $ docker-compose up
    ```

* You can edit the server name and Lastuser settings in the `docker-compose.yml` file

If you encounter a problem setting up, please look at existing issue reports
on GitHub before filing a new issue. This code is the same version used in
production so there is a very good chance you did something wrong and there
is no actual problem in the code. Issues you encounter after setup could
be real bugs.

WSGI is recommended for production. For Apache: enable `mod_wsgi` and make a
`VirtualHost` with:

    WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/website.wsgi

For Nginx, run website.py under uWSGI and proxy to it:

    location / {
        include uwsgi_params; # Include common uWSGI settings here
        uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:8093;  # Use the port number uWSGI is running on
        uwsgi_param UWSGI_CHDIR /path/to/hasjob/git/repo/folder;
        uwsgi_param UWSGI_MODULE website;
    }
