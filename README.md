* Allow contributions to Hasjob.

HasGeek is a business, and like any business has trade secrets, intellectual
property and competition. Hasjob’s code is not intended to be used to setup
rival job boards.

license. You may not make a proprietary fork.

To have your contributions merged back into the master repository, you must

Hasjob can be used with Docker (recommended for quick start) or the harder way with a manual setup (recommended for getting involved).

## With Docker

#### Install and run with Docker

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) and [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

* Next, rename the `instance/development.docker.py` to `instance/development.py`

* Build the images

    ```
    $ docker-compose build
    ```

* Initialize the database

    ```
    $ docker-compose run web sh
        web$ python manage.py db create
        web$ exit
    ```

* Start the server
    
    ```
    $ docker-compose up
    ```

* You can edit the server name and Lastuser settings in `docker-compose.yml`

## Without Docker

Hasjob without Docker requires manual installation of all dependencies.

### Postgres and Redis

Hasjob requires Postgres >= 9.4 and Redis. To set up a Postgres DB:

On OS X using the [Postgres App](http://postgresapp.com):

    $ # Add Postgres app to the path if it's not already in there
    $ export PATH="/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin:$PATH"
    $ # Make the user and database
    $ createuser -d hasjob
    $ createdb -O hasjob -W hasjob

On any Linux distribution:

    $ sudo -u postgres createuser -d hasgeek
    $ sudo -u postgres createdb -O hasgeek hasjob

Edit `instance/development.py` to set the variable `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` to `postgres://hasjob:YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE@localhost:5432/hasjob`.

Redis does not require special configuration, but must listen on localhost and port 6379 (default).

### Local URLs

Hasjob makes use of subdomains to serve different sub-boards for jobs. To set it up:

* Edit `/etc/hosts` and add these entries (substituting `your-machine` with whatever you call your computer):

    ```
    127.0.0.1    hasjob.your-machine.local
    127.0.0.1    static.hasjob.your-machine.local
    127.0.0.1    subboard.hasjob.your-machine.local
    ```

* Edit `instance/development.py` and change `SERVER_NAME` to `'hasjob.your-machine.local:5000'`

### Install dependencies

Hasjob runs on [Python](https://www.python.org) with the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) microframework.

#### Virutalenv + pip

If you are going to use a computer on which you would work on multiple Python based projects, [Virtualenv](docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) is strongly recommended to ensure Hasjob’s elaborate and sometimes version-specific requirements doesn't clash with anything else.

You will need to install all the requirements listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip`:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

If you intend to actively contribute to Hasjob code, some functionality is sourced from the related libraries [coaster](https://github.com/hasgeek/coaster), [baseframe](https://github.com/hasgeek/baseframe) and [Flask-Lastuser](https://github.com/hasgeek/flask-lastuser). You may want to clone these repositories separately and put them in development mode:

    $ cd ..
    $ git clone https://github.com/hasgeek/coaster.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/hasgeek/baseframe.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/hasgeek/flask-lastuser.git
    $ pip uninstall coaster baseframe flask-lastuser
    $ for DIR in coaster baseframe flask-lastuser; do cd $DIR; python setup.py develop; cd ..; done
    $ cd baseframe && make && cd ..

Finish configuration with:

    $ python manage.py db create

Before you run the server in development mode, make sure you have Postgres server and Redis server running as well. To start Hasjob:

    $ python runserver.py

## Create root board

Some functionality in Hasjob requires the presence of a sub-board named `www`. Create it by visiting `http://hasjob.your-machine.local:5000/board` (or the `/board` page on whatever hostname and port you used for your installation). The `www` board is a special-case to refer to the root website.

## Periodic jobs

Hasjob requires some tasks to be run in periodic background jobs. These can be called from cron. Use `crontab -e` as the user account running Hasjob and add:

    */5 * * * * cd /path/to/hasjob; python manage.py periodic sessions -e dev
    */5  * * * * cd /path/to/hasjob; python manage.py periodic impressions -e dev

Switch from `dev` to `production` in a production environment.

## Testing

Tests are outdated at this time, but whatever tests exist are written in [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/).

You need to [install CasperJS](http://docs.casperjs.org/en/latest/installation.html), which needs Python 2.6 (or greater) and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) installed.

Edit the top few lines of test file `tests/test_job_post.js` with the URL, username and password.

Run the test with `casperjs test tests/test_job_post.js`.

## Other notes

If you encounter a problem setting up, please look at existing issue reports
on GitHub before filing a new issue. This code is the same version used in
production so there is a very good chance you did something wrong and there
is no actual problem in the code. Issues you encounter after setup could
be real bugs.

WSGI is recommended for production. For Apache: enable `mod_wsgi` and make a
`VirtualHost` with:

    WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/hasjob/git/repo/folder/website.py

For Nginx, run website.py under uWSGI and proxy to it:

    location / {
        include uwsgi_params; # Include common uWSGI settings here
        uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:8093;  # Use the port number uWSGI is running on
        uwsgi_param UWSGI_CHDIR /path/to/hasjob/git/repo/folder;
        uwsgi_param UWSGI_MODULE website;
    }
